1. analyze historic performance of their mutual fund portfolios
2. look at key performance metrics and assess if their currect portfolio is fit to achieve their goals
3. use modern portfolio theory, employed by professional money managers, to come up with an optimal portfolio to match their return expectations and risk tolerance
